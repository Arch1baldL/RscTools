\usage{
run_qc(
  object_list,
  species = "mouse",
  max_nFeature_RNA = 5000,
  max_percent_mt = 3,
  scale_all_genes = TRUE,
  plot_qc = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object_list}{A Seurat object or a named list of Seurat objects.}

\item{species}{Character string indicating the species. Currently supports "mouse" (default) and "human".}

\item{max_nFeature_RNA}{Numeric. Filtering threshold for maximum number of genes per cell. Default is 5000.}

\item{max_percent_mt}{Numeric. Filtering threshold for maximum mitochondrial percentage. Default is 3.}

\item{scale_all_genes}{Logical. Whether to scale all genes during 'ScaleData'.
If TRUE (default), all genes are scaled (compute-intensive). If FALSE, only variable features are scaled.}

\item{plot_qc}{Logical. Whether to print QC violin plots before and after filtering. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list of processed Seurat objects.
}
\description{
This function accepts a named list of Seurat objects and performs a standard QC workflow including:
calculating mitochondrial percentage, filtering cells based on QC metrics, plotting QC violin plots,
and running standard preprocessing steps (NormalizeData, FindVariableFeatures, and ScaleData).
