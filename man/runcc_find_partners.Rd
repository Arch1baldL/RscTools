\title{Find Partner Cells from Cell-Cell Interaction Nets}
\usage{
runcc_find_partners(
  object,
  source = NULL,
  target = NULL,
  measure = c("weight", "count"),
  top_n = 3,
  p_threshold = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object containing a \code{net} list with \code{weight}, \code{count}, and \code{pval} matrices.}

\item{source}{Character vector of source cell types to include.}

\item{target}{Character vector of target cell types to include.}

\item{measure}{Character string, either \code{"weight"} or \code{"count"}, controlling which net matrix to analyze.}

\item{top_n}{Integer number of top partners to return per source.}

\item{p_threshold}{Numeric significance cutoff applied to the \code{net$pval} matrix.}
}
\value{
A tibble of top partner records per source, sorted by source and value.
}
\description{
This helper filters an interaction matrix for significant source->target edges, calculates a specificity score,
and returns the top partners per source for either weighted strength or interaction counts.
